### Key characteristics:

**Scalability**: Capability of a system, procress or the network to grow and manage increased demand.

**Horizontal scaling**: Adding more machines to your pool.
**Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power(CPU, RAM...) to a existing server.

**Reliability**: Probability that a system will fail in given period.
**Availability**: Time that a system remain operational during given period.

**Efficiency**: Generally two standards -> response time(latency) & throughput(bandwidth).

**Load balancer**: A component that spread traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness and availability. 

+ Load balancer can be placed between any two layer in the general 3 layer web application.
