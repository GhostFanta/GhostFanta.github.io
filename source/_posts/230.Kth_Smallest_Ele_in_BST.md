title: 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
category: Algorithm
---
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
```

##### Analyzation:
Time complexity should be `O(H+k)` where `H=log(N)` stands for the height of the tree and `k` stands


##### Solution:
Iterative solution:
